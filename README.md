- Hi, I’m Devin Lynch (@dlynch42). I am a graduate from CU Boulder, where I earned a degree in Economics and played football.
- I’m interested in statistics, data modeling, machine learning, financial engineering, software engineering, and game development, while keeping an open mind to the many different areas of computer science.
- My primary language that I use is Python, while I am very comfortable in C#, C, C++, HTML, CSS, and R. I also have experience in Xcode, Java, and Matlab. Some of the Python libraries I use are Tensorflow, Scikit-Learn, Keras, Numpy, Pandas, GGPlot, among many others. 
- I’m currently advancing my abilities in C, C#, and C++ geared more towards software engineering with Harvard's CS50, as well as with other online classes in Udemy and videos on YouTube.
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything stimulating. I am looking to learn, be a sponge, and contribute to a project and team.

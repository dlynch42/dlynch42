- Hi, I’m Devin Lynch (@dlynch42). I am a graduate from CU Boulder, where I earned a degree in Economics and played football.
- I’m interested in statistics, data modeling, financial engineering, software engineering, and game development.
- The languages I am very comfortable in are Python, HTML, C#, C, and R. I also have a decent amount of experience in C++, Xcode, CSS, Java, and Matlab. 
- I’m currently advancing my abilities in C and C# geared more towards software engineering.
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything stimulating. I am looking to learn and be a sponge.

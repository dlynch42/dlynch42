- Hi, I’m Devin Lynch (@dlynch42). I am a graduate from CU Boulder, where I earned a degree in Economics and played football.
- I’m interested in statistics, data modeling, financial engineering, software engineering, and game development. Software and gaming have become a recent hobby of mine that really peaked my interest within the last 6 months.
- The languages I am very comfortable in are C, C#, and Python, but I know C++, Java, and Matlab as well. 
- I’m currently advancing my abilities in C and C# geared more towards software engineering.
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything stimulating. I am looking to learn and be a sponge.

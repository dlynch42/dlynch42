- Hi, I’m Devin Lynch (@dlynch42). I am a graduate student at CU Boulder studying Comp. Sci., where I currently hold a 4.0 GPA and earned an undergraduate degree in Economics with a minor in Business. I also played football as an inside linebacker.
- I’m well trained in full stack software engineering, data engineering, and machine learning engineering, as well as quantitative development. My areas of interest include machine learning, automation/AI, full stack development, robotics/autonomous systems, and quantitative finance.
- My primary languages that I use are Python, SQL, Typescript/Javascript, and C++. I also have familiarity in the entire C family, Java family, Swift, R, and Matlab. I use Next, Node, and React for web dev, and Tensorflow, PyTorch, Ultralytics, and Sklearn for Machine Learning.
- In my personal life, I surf, ski, lift, hike, love screamy screamy music, and hang with my friends and family.
- Open to connecting, collaborating, and sharing new ideas.

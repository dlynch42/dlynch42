- Hi, I’m Devin Lynch (@dlynch42). I am a graduate student at CU Boulder for Comp. Sci., where I also earned a degree in Economics and played football.
- I’m well trained in software and machine learning engineering, as well as quantitative development. My areas of interest include full stack development, machine learning, automation/AI, robotics, and quantitative finance.
- My primary languages that I use are Python, Typescript, C/C++, and SQL. I also have familiarity in R and Matlab. I use Next and React for web dev, and Tensorflow, PyTorch, Ultralytics, and Sklearn for Machine Learning.
- In my personal life, I surf, ski, lift, hike, make music (screamy screamy), and hang with my friends and family.
- Open to connecting, collaborating, and sharing new ideas.
